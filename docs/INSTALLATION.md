# Installation and local runtime

**Status: source preview.** The repository can be built, tested, run as a STDIO
MCP server, loaded through its local Codex marketplace, and materialized into six
experimental host packs. There is no public npm package, remote marketplace,
signed release, or supported clean-machine distribution yet.

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=24.15.0`
- npm and the checked-in `package-lock.json`
- Codex with plugin support for the Codex-native preview
- optional Python 3 with `venv` and installed Codex system skills for the
  official Codex-only validation pass
- optional Git and ripgrep; context discovery falls back to the filesystem when unavailable

No separate model API key, browser package, database server, service manager, open port, or global npm install is required.

## Build and verify from source

From the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run typecheck
npm run format:check
npm run check
node packages/cli/dist/bin.js doctor --json
```

`npm run build` compiles the workspaces, regenerates
`plugins/telic/dist/mcp/server.js`, and synchronizes the canonical skill and
bundle into the adapter packs. `npm run check` is clean-runner-safe: it runs
formatting, build, the threshold-enforced coverage suite, repository-local Codex
asset validation, marketplace validation, and adapter validation.

When Codex's official validator scripts are installed under `CODEX_HOME`
(default `~/.codex`), add the authoritative host-specific pass:

```bash
npm run check:official
```

The official wrapper creates an ignored virtual environment under `.cache/`
and installs hash-pinned PyYAML `6.0.3` on first use. It checks for the
machine-local validator before bootstrapping. Those official scripts are not a
repository dependency and are therefore not required by portable CI.

The packages are private workspace packages. `npm ci` installs them for development; it does not publish or globally install Telic.

## Run the local MCP server

The standalone plugin bundle starts over STDIO:

```bash
TELIC_REPOSITORY_ROOT="$PWD" node plugins/telic/dist/mcp/server.js
```

Or use the built CLI:

```bash
TELIC_REPOSITORY_ROOT="$PWD" node packages/cli/dist/bin.js mcp
```

The server writes MCP protocol traffic to stdout and diagnostics to stderr. It exits when the client disconnects or sends a termination signal. There is no background daemon.

## Load the local Codex plugin

The source tree contains:

```text
plugins/telic/
├── .codex-plugin/plugin.json
├── .mcp.json
├── dist/mcp/server.js
└── skills/telic/
```

Build first so the bundled server matches the TypeScript source. Then add the repository's local marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add "$PWD/.agents/plugins" --json
codex plugin list --available --json
codex plugin add telic@personal --json
codex plugin list --json
codex mcp list --json
```

The marketplace manifest currently names itself `personal`. If Codex reports a different configured name or a naming collision, use the name returned by the first command. Start a fresh Codex session after installation so skill and MCP discovery use the installed snapshot.

Use `/skills` to select Telic, or explicitly activate the installed skill in a
prompt:

```text
Use $telic:telic to investigate this repository. Analyze only; do not change files.
```

This is a development installation from the current working tree, not a published judge path. It modifies the user's Codex marketplace/plugin configuration, so review the displayed paths and output before proceeding.

Codex reserves slash commands for its command surface. Reusable skill workflows
use `/skills` or a `$skill` mention. Do not add a deprecated custom prompt only
to manufacture `/telic` in Codex.

### Remove the preview install

Use the configured marketplace name shown by `codex plugin marketplace list`:

```bash
codex plugin remove telic@personal --json
codex plugin marketplace remove personal --json
```

These commands remove Codex's installed plugin/cache and marketplace entry. They do not remove the source checkout or Telic run state.

## Materialize another host pack

Build and validate the shared packs first:

```bash
npm run build
npm run adapters:validate
npm run adapters:test
```

When `agy` or `kiro-cli` is already installed, their native schema validators
can also run:

```bash
npm run adapters:validate:native
```

The Claude Code and Antigravity directories are plugin-shaped source previews.
Cursor, Kiro, Cline, and Roo are project overlays that must be merged into the
target repository rather than copied over existing configuration blindly. See
[`adapters/README.md`](../adapters/README.md) for exact paths, activation names,
and host-specific cautions. A successful local MCP handshake does not certify
install, permission, upgrade, or uninstall behavior in that host.

## Runtime lifecycle

```text
Codex activates telic:telic
        |
        v
Codex launches plugin-provided Telic STDIO process
        |
        v
Host model calls seven deterministic Telic tools
        |
        v
Artifacts and trace persist in local XDG state
        |
        v
Codex disconnects; the process exits
```

The host model performs semantic work. The MCP process does not call or inherit the host model, and it has no model credential.

## State location

By default, each real repository path maps to:

```text
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/telic/repositories/<repository-hash>/
```

The repository hash is the first 24 hexadecimal characters of a SHA-256 digest of the canonical absolute repository path. This keeps ledgers and exact selected source out of the working tree.

Override the complete directory when isolation or explicit cleanup is useful:

```bash
TELIC_STATE_DIR=/tmp/telic-demo-state \
  TELIC_REPOSITORY_ROOT="$PWD" \
  node plugins/telic/dist/mcp/server.js
```

Do not point `TELIC_STATE_DIR` inside a repository you may commit. Telic rejects unsafe state-directory symlinks, but users remain responsible for OS permissions, backups, and retention.

The CLI reports the resolved location:

```bash
TELIC_STATE_DIR=/tmp/telic-demo-state \
  node packages/cli/dist/bin.js doctor --repo "$PWD" --json
```

## Inspect an existing run

```bash
TELIC_STATE_DIR=/tmp/telic-demo-state \
  node packages/cli/dist/bin.js status RUN_ID --repo "$PWD" --json
TELIC_STATE_DIR=/tmp/telic-demo-state \
  node packages/cli/dist/bin.js trace RUN_ID --repo "$PWD" --json
TELIC_STATE_DIR=/tmp/telic-demo-state \
  node packages/cli/dist/bin.js artifact RUN_ID ARTIFACT_ID --repo "$PWD" --json
```

These commands require the same state directory used when the MCP server created
the run. Omit the prefix when the server used the default. They are read-only
ledger views; there is no visual inspector yet.

## Troubleshooting

### Node check fails

Use a Node version satisfying `>=24.15.0`; the core uses the current built-in `node:sqlite` API.

### MCP starts for the wrong repository

Set `TELIC_REPOSITORY_ROOT` to the absolute target repository or ensure Codex launches the plugin with that repository as its working directory.

### No ledger exists

`status`, `trace`, and `artifact` do not create a run. Confirm the repository and `TELIC_STATE_DIR`, then start a run through MCP.

### Skill or MCP is missing after install

Run `npm run build`, validate the plugin, inspect `codex plugin list --json` and `codex mcp list --json`, and start a new Codex session. The installed skill's qualified name is `telic:telic`.

### `git` or `rg` is absent

Grounding falls back to the filesystem and records the selected inventory source and warnings. Install them only if desired; Telic does not install global tools.

## Release installation target

Before the preview becomes a release, the project still needs a public
repository/package decision, a pinned remote marketplace or equivalent artifact,
checksums/provenance, clean-machine install and uninstall evidence, tested
upgrade behavior, and a monitored vulnerability-reporting channel. Until then,
do not present source-preview commands as a stable end-user installation
contract.

### Planned `npx` shape

The simplest public distribution is one bundled runner rather than five
independently versioned workspace packages. A future package could expose:

```bash
npx -y @dukeabaddon/telic doctor
npx -y @dukeabaddon/telic mcp
```

Publication requires a chosen available package name, npm account or
organization ownership, explicit public-publish approval, trusted-publisher or
local npm authentication, and a monitored vulnerability-reporting contact. The
package still needs `bin`, an exact file allowlist, license/repository metadata,
packed-tarball inspection, clean temporary installation, doctor, and MCP
handshake tests. It does not need a model API key.
